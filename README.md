# 📱 ML-Based Smartphone Price Prediction App  

This project is an **end-to-end Machine Learning application** that predicts the **resale value of used smartphones** based on their specifications, condition, and usage.  
It also provides a feature to **compare two mobiles side by side** to help users make better selling or buying decisions.  

Built with **Python, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit**, this app demonstrates how a simple ML model can be transformed into a professional, interactive tool.

- Shows a **price range (±5%)** for negotiation.  
- Displays quick metrics:
  - Battery %
  - Age of phone
  - Drop from original price  
- Visual insights:
  - **Original vs Predicted bar chart**  
  - **Depreciation curve (value over years)**  
- Provides **recommendation messages**:
  - Good resale value → Sell  
  - Average value → Negotiate/Wait  
  - Low value → Keep using
